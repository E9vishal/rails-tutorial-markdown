Markdown(ish) version of the Rails Tutorial Book
================================================

Cool! So...why?
---------------

grep, my friend. The HTML of the Rails Tutorial Book is made available, but
if you wish to grep a portion of the code from the sample_app repo to learn
what it does, you'll be treated with HTML in your terminal!

So I just ran ```html2text``` on all the html files, did a few minutes worth of
decluttering, and this is the result.
